# Neural Flow

This is a python script to plot the intermediate layer output of Mistral 7B. When you run the script it will produce a 512x256 image representing the output at every layer of the model. 


# Constants
There are two file paths you will want to change before running the script:

```
model_folder = "/models/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B"
image_output_folder = "/home/username/Desktop/"
```

This is self explanitory, but set the model folder to the location of your Mistral 7B, and the image output folder to the path you'd like to save your image.
